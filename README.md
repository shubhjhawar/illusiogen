![illusiogen](https://github.com/shubhjhawar/illusiogen/assets/67875612/39dafb6d-a829-400b-ab47-258d18be5a90)

Illusiogen is a simple yet powerful full-stack web application that utilizes OpenAI's DALL-E image generation API to bring your imagination to life. It allows users to create and share images based on prompts they provide, which are then generated by the AI model. The application consists of a frontend built with React (Vite-based) and a backend powered by Node.js. Images are stored on Cloudinary, and the metadata is stored in a real MongoDB database.
